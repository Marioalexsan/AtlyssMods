# ===== Pack metadata ===== #

# Set an ID for your audio pack.
# This should be as unique as possible. If not set, one will be made for you.

%id Marioalexsan_MyCoolTemplateMod

# Set a display name. This is used in the UI for configuration options.
# If not set, a (very ugly) display name will be made for you.

# Modify the volume of your custom clips. This allows you to both amplify and attenuate clips.
# In fact, this is the only way to edit the volume of custom clips in a reliable way.

%customclipvolume click01_var01 = 0.8 
%customclipvolume click01_var02 = 1.2
%customclipvolume click01_var03 = 1.5

# ===== Basic replacements ===== #

# This is the old 1.1.0 format for creating audio replacements.
# It's still supported and is a really simple format for routes, but it lacks features.
# The mod will automatically load the corresponding targetClipName's audio file
# The format is as follows:
#
#    sourceClipName = targetClipName / randomWeight
#    sourceClipName = targetClipName
#
# When using the second format, randomWeight is set to 1.0

_mu_flyby = main_menu / 4.0
_mu_flyby = main_menu_rare

_uiHover = click01_var01
_uiHover = click01_var02
_uiHover = click01_var03

# ===== Advanced replacements ===== #

# Advanced replacements, overlays, and effects can be made using the full format:
#
#    sourceClipNames = targetClips @ overlayClips ~ effects
#
# It's not necessary for targetClips, overlayClips, and effects to be all present, or to be in this order.
# You can switch them around as long as you have at least one of them. For example:
#
#    sourceClips = targetClips ~ effects @ overlayClips
#    sourceClips = targetClips @ overlayClips
#    sourceClips = targetClips ~ effects
#    sourceClips = targetClips
#    sourceClips @ overlayClips
#    sourceClips ~ effects

# sourceClipNames must be an array of one or more clip names, separated by pipes ("|").

# targetClips and overlayClips must be an array of strings, separated by pipes ("|"), that follow this format:
#
#    name : selectionWeight : volume : pitch
#
# You can specify anything from one value (just the name) up to 4 values (all of the modifiers and weight), but values must come in order.
# The default value for selectionWeight, volume and pitch is 1.0
# When there's more than one clip in such an array, and this route is chosen, the mod selects between one of them randomly based on selectionWeight.
or a route.

# This plays hit01 2/3rds of the time, and hit02 1/3rd of the time.

weaponHit_Normal(average) | weaponHit_Normal(heavy) | weaponHit_Normal(light) = hit01 | hit02 : 0.5

# This plays the same clip, but 5/6ths of the time it has a volume and pitch of 0.5, while 1/6th of the time it has a volume and pitch of 0.8 / 1.5

_blockHit = block : 1.0 : 0.5 : 0.5 | block : 0.2 : 0.8 : 1.5

# This plays one of two clips alongside the original clip, i.e. without replacing it.
# If you specify a replacement, then the corresponding overlay can only play if the replacement was selected.
# Additionally, multiple overlays for the same source clip can trigger individually, unlike replacements.

_weaponHitWall @ oof : 1.0 : 0.5 : 0.5 | oof_rare : 0.2 : 0.8 : 1.5

# effects must be an array of a property name and a value, separated by pipes ("|"), for example:
#
#    propertyName : propertyValue
#
# Valid property names are "volume", "pitch", and "weight".
# Effects are applied to the audio source, and can either be a volume, pitch modifier, or the replacement weight for a route.

# Applies an effect to the vanilla day music. Keep in mind that volume modifiers that aren't set with %customclipvolume can be overriden by ATLYSS at any time.
mu_snatchsprings ~ volume : 0.4 | pitch : 1.5

# You can use ___default___ to specify a route where the clip is "replaced" with itself
# You can use ___nothing___ to specify a route where the clip is "replaced" with empty audio ("silence")
# When multiple replacements apply to the same source clip, you can specify how often a branch is selected by specifying the weight in effects

# You can use ___default___ to specify a route where the clip is "replaced" with itself.
# You can use ___nothing___ to specify a route where the clip is "replaced" with empty audio ("silence"). This might be useful alongside overlays to hack around some issues with audio cutting off.

_weaponHitWall = ___default___ ~ weight : 1.0
_weaponHitWall = wall_hit : 1.0 : 0.5 : 0.5 | wall_hit_rare : 0.2 : 0.8 : 1.5 @ echo ~ weight : 0.4
