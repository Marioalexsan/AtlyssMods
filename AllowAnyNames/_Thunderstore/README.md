# Allow Any Names

Removes restrictions on player names, allowing you to use color tags and longer names than usual:

```
<color=blue>Uke</color>
```

To set such names, you can edit the player saves under `ATLYSS/ATLYSS_Data/profileCollections`.

# Installation

The mod DLL must be placed under `ATLYSS/BepInEx/plugins/`.

# Multiplayer compatibility

In order for such names to behave correctly in multiplayer, both the server and the client need to have the mod installed.

Without it, there's a high chance your name will be set to "Null" instead.

# Mod compatibility

AllowAnyNames targets the following game versions and mods:

- ATLYSS v1.6.2b

Compatibility with other game versions and mods is not guaranteed, especially for updates with major changes.
